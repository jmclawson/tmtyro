Working with text as data is a multi-step process. After choosing and collecting documents, you'll need to load them in some structured way before anything else. Only then is it possible to "do" text analysis: tagging parts of speech, normalizing by lemma, comparing features, measuring sentiment, and so on. Even then, you'll need to communicate findings by preparing compelling explanations, tables, and visualizations of your results.

The tmtyro package aims to make these steps fast and easy.

* Purpose-built functions for collecting a corpus let you focus on *what* instead of *how*.
* Scalable functions for loading a corpus provide room for growth, from simple word count to grammar parsing and lemmatizing.
* Additional functions standardize approaches for measuring word use and vocabulary uniqueness, detecting sentiment, assessing term frequency--inverse document frequency, working with n-grams, and even building topic models.
* One simple function prepares publication-ready tables, automatically adjusting based on the kind of data used. Another simple function prepares compelling visualizations, returning clean, publication-ready figures.
* Every step is offered as a verb using complementary syntax. This keeps workflows easy to build, easy to understand, easy to explain, and easy to reproduce.

## Differentiating tmtyro

Wonderful text mining tools already exist for digital humanities classrooms and researchers working with text data, including the online tool [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org), which is both powerful and easy to use for beginners; the comparatively recent [tidytext](https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext/) package in R, designed to work with the popular [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org) package suite; and the [tm](https://tm.r-forge.r-project.org) package in R, a long-standing tool used by specialists. Their designs situate them for different audiences and purposes, but each has its own limitations. 

Voyant is one of the best-known tools for working with text data in the humanities. Developed by StÃ©fan Sinclair and Geoffrey Rockwell over more than twenty years, it has become a standard---and with good reason. Its graphical interface makes it accessible to novices without skimping on power or features. Still, Voyant's easy-to-use interface ultimately limits users' growth, since that interface can keep Voyant from serving as a skills ramp to other tools with more options.

Unlike tools with graphical interfaces, code-based methods for working with text offer both reproducibility and open-ended tooling. In R, the tidytext package authored by Julia Silge and David Robinson is made using a "tidy data" design philosophy that is consistent with many popular R packages. A companion book, [*Text Mining with R*](https://www.tidytextmining.com), offers impressive documentation to the package, easing the learning curve for anyone new to text mining. But its preface acknowledges a starting point quite a ways above zero, expecting that "the reader is at least slightly familiar with dplyr, ggplot2, and the %>% 'pipe' operator in R." Without the book, tidytext is even less suited for beginners who must get up to speed before they can use it.

If the tidytext package is a helpful tool to be picked up by a seasoned R user familiar with the tidyverse, then the tm package, by contrast, is the kind of tool for which specialists will learn R to use. Created by Ingo Feinerer and Kurt Hornik, it predates the tidyverse package by nearly a decade, and its data design is often incompatible with those workflows. Nevertheless, it provides power and specialized functionality beyond these other tools, making it worth learning for those who need it.

![](skill_speedometer.png)

In this context, the tmtyro package steps cautiously into the remaining space to fill a particular need. Developed while teaching two semesters of an undergraduate course on literary text mining, it grew from a folder of "helper" functions written for students. Our course was taught in the English department, and it was never meant to be a "coding class" so much as one that induced students to think about text in new ways. The syllabus followed through examples from *Text Mining in R* and, ambitiously, *Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature*, by Matthew Jockers and Rosamond Thalken, pairing methods with applications in recent research. Each week, students applied techniques to ask their own questions about their own selections of writing. Having working tools in front of us helped everyone test the boundaries of this new world and map how we might follow similar paths to those laid out in the readings. 

Like Voyant, tmtyro is designed for a beginner, and it strives for predictability. Workflows are provided for loading texts from a folder or for getting a corpus of texts from online collections. Once texts are loaded, repetitive conventions for function names make it easy to add columns for analysis, and generic functions handle details of tables and figures. 

Most importantly, tmtyro provides a skills ramp for users who outgrow it. Code workflows are designed to help beginners move quickly at the start to try things out. From there, a student who gains confidence in the methods provided by the package might step beyond it to tweak a visualization using functions from ggplot2. A researcher wishing to work with a subset of titles will begin to understand methods from dplyr. And since tmtyro's data design is based on that of tidytext, a user can transition between both packages seamlessly, using them together. Nobody is expected to stick with tmtyro forever, but functions are designed to remain useful long past the "tyro" stage.

## Preparing texts 

tmtyro offers a few functions to gather and load texts for study:

* `get_gutenberg_corpus()` caches the HTML version of books by their Project Gutenberg ID, parses their text and headers, and presents them in a table.
* `get_micusp_corpus()` caches papers from the Michigan Corpus of Upper-level Student Papers, parses them for metadata and contents, and presents them in a table.
* `download_once()` caches an online file and passes the local path invisibly.
* `load_texts()` prepares a table in "tidytext" format with one word per row and columns for metadata. These texts can be loaded from a folder of files or passed from a table. Parameters allow for lemmatization, part-of-speech processing, and other options.

Other functions aid with preparing a corpus:

* `move_header_to_text()` corrects overzealous identification of HTML headers when parsing books from Project Gutenberg.
* `standardize_titles()` converts a vector or column into title case, converts underscores with spaces, and optionally removes initial articles.
* `identify_by()` sets a column of metadata to serve as document marker.

### Get a corpus

Collecting texts from Project Gutenberg will be a common first step for many. The function `get_gutenberg_corpus()` needs only the Gutenberg ID number, found in the book's URL. The resulting table draws metadata from the gutenbergr package, with columns for "gutenberg_id", "title", "author", headers such as those used for chapters, and "text."

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tmtyro)
joyce <- get_gutenberg_corpus(c(2814, 4217, 4300))

joyce
```

In some cases, headers may make better sense if read as part of the text, as in the "Aeolus" chapter of *Ulysses*, where frequent newspaper headlines pepper the page:

```{r}
ulysses <- get_gutenberg_corpus(4300)

# dplyr is used here to choose a smaller example for comparison
ulysses |> 
  dplyr::filter(section == "[ 7 ]")
```

These can be corrected with `move_header_to_text()`.

```{r}
ulysses <- get_gutenberg_corpus(4300) |> 
  move_header_to_text(subsection)

# dplyr is used here to choose a smaller example for comparison
ulysses |> 
  dplyr::filter(section == "[ 7 ]")
```

Headers can be moved for specific texts in a corpus by specifying a filter like `title == "Ulysses"`:

```{r}
joyce <- joyce |> 
  move_header_to_text(subsection, title == "Ulysses")

joyce |> 
  dplyr::filter(section == "[ 7 ]")
```

### Load texts

`load_texts()` prepares a set of documents for study, either from a table or from a folder of files.

#### From a table

A table like the one prepared by `get_gutenberg_corpus()` can be prepared in tidytext format with one word per row using `load_texts()`. 

```{r}
corpus_ulysses <- ulysses |> 
  load_texts()

corpus_ulysses
```

#### From files

If text files are already collected in a folder on disk, they can be prepared in a table by passing the path to the folder inside `load_texts()`. Used this way, `load_texts()` will load up every file using the "txt" file extension, populating the `doc_id` column with the first part of the file name.

```{r}
#| eval: false
corpus_austen <- load_texts("austen")
```

In this example, the "austen" folder is found within the current project. If it was instead found somewhere else on the computer, the complete path can be passed like this:<br> `load_texts("~/corpora/austen")`

### Choose a different `doc_id`

Documents loaded from `get_gutenberg_corpus()` use the `gutenberg_id` column as their document identifier. 

```{r}
corpus_dubliners <- get_gutenberg_corpus(2814) |> 
  load_texts(lemma = TRUE, pos = TRUE)

corpus_dubliners
```

If a different column is preferred, `identify_by()` makes the switch. In this example from *Dubliners*, for instance, each story's title is shown under "part". The `identify_by()` function makes it easy to identify documents by that column:

```{r}
corpus_dubliners <- corpus_dubliners |> 
  identify_by(part)

corpus_dubliners
```

### Standardize titles

The `standardize_titles()` function converts titles to something cleaner by adopting title case.

```{r}
before <- unique(corpus_dubliners$doc_id)

corpus_dubliners <- corpus_dubliners |> 
  standardize_titles()

after <- unique(corpus_dubliners$doc_id)

data.frame(before, after)
```

## Studying texts

Most functions for studying texts follow a predictable naming convention: 

* `add_vocabulary()` adds columns measuring the lexical variety of texts.
* `add_sentiment()` adds a column of sentiment identifiers from a chosen lexicon.
* `add_ngrams()` adds columns of words for bigrams, trigrams, or more.

Not every method preserves the size or shape of data passed to it:

* `summarize_tf_idf()` returns a data frame for every token in each document in a corpus, with columns indicating weights for term frequency-inverse document frequency.

Along with these, other functions assist with the process:

* `drop_empty()` drops rows with missing data in any column or in specified columns.
* `combine_ngrams()` combines multiple columns for n-grams into one.
* `separate_ngrams()` separatesa  single column of n-grams into one column per word.

### Vocabulary richness

The `add_vocabulary()` function adds measurements of vocabulary richness, including cumulative vocabulary size, indicators of hapax legomena, and markers of progress.

```{r}
vocab_dubliners <- 
  corpus_dubliners |> 
  add_vocabulary()

vocab_dubliners
```

### Sentiment

`add_sentiment()` adds measurements of sentiment using the "Bing" lexicon by default.

```{r}
#| eval: false
sentiment_dubliners <- corpus_dubliners |> 
  add_sentiment()

sentiment_dubliners
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
if (interactive()) {
  sentiment_dubliners <- corpus_dubliners |> 
    add_sentiment()
  saveRDS(sentiment_dubliners, "sentiment_dubliners.Rds")
} else {
  sentiment_dubliners <- readRDS("sentiment_dubliners.Rds")
}

sentiment_dubliners
```

#### Dropping empty rows

Since many words may not be found in a given sentiment lexicon, `drop_empty()` makes it easy to remove empty rows.

```{r}
sentiment_dubliners |> 
  drop_empty(sentiment)
```

#### Choosing a sentiment lexicon

The lexicon can be chosen at measurement.

```{r}
#| eval: false
sentiment_ulysses <- ulysses |> 
  load_texts() |> 
  identify_by(section) |> 
  add_sentiment(lexicon = "nrc")

sentiment_ulysses |> 
  drop_empty(sentiment)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
if (interactive()) {
  sentiment_ulysses <- ulysses |> 
    load_texts() |> 
    identify_by(section) |> 
    add_sentiment(lexicon = "nrc")
  saveRDS(sentiment_ulysses, "sentiment_ulysses.Rds")
} else {
  sentiment_ulysses <- readRDS("sentiment_ulysses.Rds")
}

sentiment_ulysses |> 
  drop_empty(sentiment)
```

### N-grams

Following the same pattern, `add_ngrams()` adds columns for n-length phrases of words. By default, it prepares bigrams (or 2-grams).

```{r}
corpus_joyce <- joyce |> 
  load_texts() |> 
  identify_by(title)

bigrams_joyce <- corpus_joyce |> 
  add_ngrams()

bigrams_joyce
```

Other n-grams can be chosen by passing a vector of numbers.

```{r}
trigrams_joyce <- corpus_joyce |> 
  add_ngrams(1:3)

trigrams_joyce
```

### Tf-idf

Unlike other measurements, term frequency--inverse document frequency doesn't preserve word order, and it reduces documents to one instance of each token. Since any use of tf-idf can't merely add a column, `summarize_tf_idf()` avoids the `add_` naming convention. Results are returned in descending strength of tf-idf.

```{r}
tfidf_dubliners <- corpus_dubliners |> 
  summarize_tf_idf()

tfidf_dubliners
```

Tf-idf's method understandably emphasizes proper nouns that are unique to each document. The `remove_names` argument in `load_texts()` can help to filter out words that appear only in capitalized form. Removing names from *Dubliners* makes a noticeable difference in tf-idf results:

```{r}
tfidf_dubliners <- get_gutenberg_corpus(2814) |> 
  load_texts(remove_names = TRUE) |> 
  identify_by(part) |> 
  standardize_titles() |> 
  summarize_tf_idf()

tfidf_dubliners
```

If `load_texts()` is used with `pos = TRUE`, proper nouns can be filtered, but these tags are sometimes inaccurate.

## Preparing tables

The `tabulize()` function prepares tables for every kind of measurement. This repetition makes it easy to see and appreciate findings without struggling to recall a specialized function.

### Corpus details

By default, `tabulize()` prepares a table showing the lengths of each document.

```{r}
corpus_joyce |> 
  tabulize()
```


### Word counts

Adding `count = TRUE` will show the counts of the most-frequent words.

```{r}
corpus_joyce |> 
  tabulize(count = TRUE)
```

### Vocabulary richness

When used after `add_vocabulary()`, the `tabulize()` function prepares a clean summary table.

```{r}
corpus_joyce |> 
  add_vocabulary() |> 
  tabulize()
```

### Sentiment

For sentiment analysis, `tabulize()` returns a summary of figures for each document.

```{r}
# dplyr is used here to choose a smaller example for comparison
sentiment_dubliners_part <- sentiment_dubliners |> 
  dplyr::filter(doc_id %in% c("The Sisters", "An Encounter",  "Araby"))

sentiment_dubliners_part |> 
  tabulize()
```

Setting `drop_empty = TRUE` removes rows without sentiment measure.

```{r}
sentiment_dubliners_part |> 
  tabulize(drop_empty = TRUE)
```

The `ignore` parameter aids in selecting a subset of sentiments, converting the rest to `NA`.

```{r}
# dplyr is used here to choose a smaller example for comparison
sentiment_ulysses_part <- sentiment_ulysses |> 
  dplyr::filter(doc_id %in% c("[ 1 ]", "[ 2 ]", "[ 3 ]"))

sentiment_ulysses_part |> 
  tabulize(ignore = c("anger", "anticipation", "disgust", "fear", "trust", "positive", "negative"))
```

### N-grams

After `add_ngrams()`, the `tabulize()` function returns the top n-grams per document. By default, the first six are shown for each group, but rows can be chosen freely.

```{r}
bigrams_joyce |> 
  tabulize(rows = 1:2)
```

### Tf-idf

For data frames prepared with `summarize_tf_idf()`, the `tabulize()` function returns six rows of the top-scoring words for each document. This amount can be specified with the `rows` argument.

```{r}
tfidf_dubliners |> 
  tabulize(rows = 1:3)
```


## Preparing figures

tmtyro provides many functions for preparing figures, but only one is typically needed:

* `visualize()` works intuitively with tmtyro objects, preparing figures suited to whatever work is being done. 

Customization is easy:

* `change_colors()` provides a single interface for modifying filled and colored layers.

### Corpus details

By default, `visualize()` prepares a figure showing the lengths of each document.

```{r}
corpus_joyce |> 
  visualize(inorder = FALSE)
```

### Word counts

Adding `count = TRUE` will show the counts of the most-frequent words.

```{r}
corpus_joyce |> 
  visualize(count = TRUE)
```

### Vocabulary richness

When used after `add_vocabulary()`, the `visualize()` function charts each document by its length and the number of unique tokens. A figure like this is useful to compare documents by their rate of vocabulary growth.

```{r}
corpus_dubliners |> 
  add_vocabulary() |> 
  visualize()
```

Other features, such as type-token ratio ("ttr"), hapax-token ratio ("htr"), or a sampling of hapax legomena ("hapax") can also be shown. 

```{r}
vocab_dubliners |> 
  visualize("ttr")
```

```{r}
corpus_joyce |> 
  add_vocabulary() |> 
  visualize("hapax")
```

### Sentiment

For sentiment analysis, `visualize()` allows for comparison among documents in a set.

```{r}
sentiment_dubliners |> 
  visualize()
```

The `ignore` parameter stipulates values to remove from the Y-axis to focus a figure.

```{r}
sentiment_ulysses |> 
  visualize(ignore = c("anger", "anticipation", "disgust", "fear", "trust", "positive", "negative"))
```

### N-grams

For n-grams, `visualize()` typically returns a network visualization like that demonstrated in *Text Mining with R*.

```{r}
#| message: false
bigrams_joyce |> 
  visualize()
```

### Combining n-grams

N-gram frequencies can be compared by combining them before visualization. Certain arguments allow for deviation from typical charts, including choosing the rows to chart and modifying colors to be set by values on the Y-axis.

```{r}
bigrams_joyce |> 
  dplyr::filter(word_1 == "he") |> 
  combine_ngrams() |> 
  visualize(rows = 1:5, color_y = TRUE)
```

### Tf-idf

The `visualize()` function returns bars showing the top words for each document. This can be a useful way to differentiate texts in a set from each other. Because `tfidf_dubliners` was prepared with `load_texts(remove_names = TRUE)`, the resulting chart shows clearer delineation of topics characteristic of the stories in Joyce's collection:

```{r}
tfidf_dubliners |> 
  visualize(rows = 1:4)
```

### Changing colors

The `change_colors()` function does what its name implies. By default, it adopts the "Dark2" palette from Brewer.

```{r}
sentiment_dubliners |> 
  visualize() |> 
  change_colors()
```

Colors can be chosen manually.

```{r}
bigrams_joyce |> 
  visualize() |> 
  change_colors("lightgreen")
```

Optionally, use a named vector to set colors by value instead of by order.

```{r}
bigrams_joyce |> 
  dplyr::filter(word_1 == "he") |> 
  combine_ngrams() |> 
  visualize(rows = 1:5, color_y = TRUE) |> 
  change_colors(c(rep("#555555",5),
                  "he is" = "blue", 
                  "he has" = "navy"))
```

Or choose a predetermined color set and palette, as described in function documentation.

```{r}
tfidf_dubliners |> 
  visualize(rows = 1:4) |> 
  change_colors(colorset = "viridis", palette = "mako", direction = -1)
```
