\title{Compare usage across a corpus}
\usage{
add_tf_idf(df, by = doc_id, feature = word)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A tidy data frame, potentially containing columns called "doc_id" and "word"}

\item{by}{A column containing document grouping}

\item{feature}{A column containing the terms to be measured across document groupings}
}
\value{
The original data frame with additional columns added for term, feature_n, (the number of times this term was used in this document), tf (term's frequency in this document), idf (inverse document frequency), and tf_idf (previous two columns combined).
}
\description{
\code{add_tf_idf()} adds measurements including term frequency by document and "tf-idf" measurements for weighing relative importance in comparison to other documents in a set.
