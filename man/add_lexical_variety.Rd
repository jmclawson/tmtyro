\title{Measure lexical variety}
\usage{
add_lexical_variety(df, by = doc_id, feature = word)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A tidy data frame, potentially containing columns called "doc_id" and "word"}

\item{by}{A grouping column}

\item{feature}{A column of words containing one word per row}
}
\value{
A data frame with 7 added columns
, the first two logical and the rest numeric:

\item \code{new_word} (logical) Indicates whether this is the first instance of a given word
\item \code{hapax} (logical) Indicates whether this word is the only incident of a given word, or hapax legomenon
\item \code{vocabulary} (integer) Running count of words used
\item \code{ttr} (double) Type-token ratio, derived from the running count of words divided by the total number of words used
\item \code{htr} (double) Hapax-token ratio, derived from the running count of hapax legomena divided by the total number of words used
\item \code{progress_words} (integer) Running count of total words used so far in a document
\item \code{progress_percent} (double) Words used so far as a percentage of the total number of words used in a document
}
}
